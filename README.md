# R-for-dataScience

You have been provided with a dataset (in the data folder above) which contains monthly data for children <5 years, disaggregated at a county level for the period January 2021 to June 2023.

The dataset contains the following varibales:
Period (months from January 2021 to June 2023)
County (the 47 counties in Kenya)
Total number of children dewormed (Total Dewormed)
Number of children <5 years with acute malnutrition (Acute Malnutrition)
Number of children stunted (0-6 months, 6-23 months, 24-59 months)
Number of children <5 years with diarrhe (Diarrhea cases)
Number of children who are underweight (0-6 months, 6-23 months, 24-59 months)
Your task is to:
## Conduct exploratory data analysis
State an appropriate research question you would want to answer from the data
Carry out appropriate data analysis to address the question you have stated above
NB: The task should be carried out as an RMarkdown [refer to the notes shared earlier]
## The research question is: "What are the trends and patterns of acute malnutrition among children under 5 years
across different counties in Kenya from January 2021 to June 2023?"
##  Conclusion:
The data analysis reveals that acute malnutrition cases in children under 5 years 
exhibit an overall upward trend and significant variations among counties from January 2021 to June 2023. 
Regions with high prevalence rates of acute malnutrition, such as Wajir, require targeted health interventions. 
The correlations between related variables highlight the need for comprehensive public health strategies to address 
acute malnutrition and related health issues in different regions. Policymakers and healthcare professionals can use 
these findings to develop targeted interventions and allocate resources effectively, aiming to reduce regional 
disparities in acute malnutrition prevalence and improve child health outcomes across Kenya.
